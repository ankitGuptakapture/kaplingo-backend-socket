# Deepgram Disconnection Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The Deepgram connection was getting disconnected due to several issues:

1. **Multiple Connection Creation**: A new Deepgram connection was created for every socket connection without proper management
2. **No Connection Cleanup**: When sockets disconnected, Deepgram connections weren't being properly closed
3. **Improper Audio Buffer Handling**: Audio buffers weren't being processed correctly
4. **Resource Conflicts**: Multiple sockets trying to use shared Deepgram connections

## Root Causes

- **Connection Management**: Each socket was creating its own Deepgram connection but not managing it properly
- **Memory Leaks**: Connections weren't being cleaned up on disconnect
- **Audio Format Issues**: Audio buffers weren't being validated or converted to proper format
- **Keepalive Problems**: Keepalive mechanism wasn't checking connection state

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Connection Management (`src/index.ts`)

- Created `DeepgramConnection` interface for proper connection tracking
- Updated `setupDeepgram()` to accept socket ID and callback parameters
- Added proper Deepgram configuration:
  ```typescript
  {
    smart_format: true,
    model: "nova-2",
    language: "en-US",
    punctuate: true,
    interim_results: true,
    endpointing: 300,
    vad_events: true,
    encoding: "linear16",
    sample_rate: 16000,
    channels: 1,
  }
  ```
- Implemented `cleanupDeepgram()` function for proper resource cleanup
- Improved keepalive mechanism with connection state checking

### 2. Per-Socket Connection Management (`socket/index.ts`)

- Each socket now maintains its own `DeepgramConnection` instance
- Added proper connection initialization on `audio:start` or first `audio:send`
- Implemented connection cleanup on socket disconnect and `audio:stop`
- Added error handling for audio buffer processing

### 3. New Event Handlers

- `audio:start` - Initialize Deepgram connection for a socket
- `audio:stop` - Clean up Deepgram connection for a socket
- `transcript:received` - Forward transcripts to room participants

### 4. Audio Buffer Improvements

- Proper buffer format validation and conversion
- Error handling for malformed audio data
- Connection state checking before sending audio
- Buffer conversion: `Buffer.isBuffer(audioBuffer) ? audioBuffer : Buffer.from(audioBuffer)`

## Key Benefits

1. **Stable Connections**: Each socket has its own properly managed Deepgram connection
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Connections are created only when needed and cleaned up properly
3. **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for audio processing
4. **Improved Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging connection issues
5. **Scalability**: Can handle multiple concurrent audio streams without conflicts

## Usage Instructions

### Client-Side Events

```javascript
// Start audio streaming (initializes Deepgram connection)
socket.emit("audio:start", { room: "room-id" });

// Send audio data
socket.emit("audio:send", { room: "room-id", audioBuffer: buffer });

// Stop audio streaming (cleans up connection)
socket.emit("audio:stop", { room: "room-id" });

// Listen for transcripts
socket.on("transcript:received", (data) => {
  console.log("Transcript:", data.transcript);
});
```

### Server-Side Logging

The server now provides detailed logging:

- Connection initialization per socket
- Keepalive status per connection
- Error handling with socket identification
- Connection cleanup tracking

## Comprehensive Transcript Logging

Added detailed logging for all transcript-related activities:

### Server-Side Logging Features

- **Transcript Reception**: Logs when transcripts are received from Deepgram
- **Transcript Content**: Logs the actual transcribed text with confidence scores
- **Final vs Interim**: Distinguishes between final and interim transcript results
- **Metadata Logging**: Logs request IDs, model info, duration, and timing data
- **Socket Forwarding**: Logs when transcripts are forwarded to room participants
- **Audio Processing**: Logs audio buffer sizes being sent to Deepgram
- **Connection Status**: Logs when Deepgram connections are not ready

### Log Format Examples

```
[TRANSCRIPT - socketId] FINAL: "Hello world" (confidence: 0.95)
[TRANSCRIPT METADATA - socketId]: { request_id: "...", model_info: {...}, duration: 2.5 }
[FORWARDING TRANSCRIPT - socketId]: "Hello world"
[SOCKET FORWARD - socketId] Sending FINAL transcript to room room-id: "Hello world"
[AUDIO SEND - socketId] Sending 16000 bytes to Deepgram
```

## Testing

- Created `test-audio.js` for basic connection testing
- Created `test-audio-with-speech.js` for enhanced audio streaming simulation
- Server starts successfully without TypeScript errors
- Test scripts connect, send audio, and disconnect properly
- Deepgram connections are managed per socket as expected
- Comprehensive logging shows all transcript processing steps

## Recommendations

1. **Audio Format**: Ensure client sends audio in linear16 format at 16kHz sample rate
2. **Connection Lifecycle**: Use `audio:start` and `audio:stop` events for proper connection management
3. **Error Monitoring**: Monitor server logs for connection issues
4. **Buffer Size**: Consider optimal buffer sizes for your use case (current test uses 1024 bytes)

The Deepgram disconnection issue has been resolved with proper connection management, resource cleanup, and improved error handling.
